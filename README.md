# Some Important Links
Easy access page to resources that help you find remote tech jobs.
If you do not have the knowledge or skill set to do the remote job you found, there are links below to all resources that will teach you the necessary knowledge or skill set for the job.

*I strive to list only good quality free resources, but below you will find some non-free resources as well. I have included only those few, because of the sheer value those provided. With that said, I still recommend first exhausting all available free resources before starting on non-free ones.*

Therefore, at this point it is up to you whether you want it or not. The resources are readily available here for your consumption.
Good Luck!
